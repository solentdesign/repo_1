# Face Recognition with Raspberry Pi

This project uses a Raspberry Pi to detect and recognise faces in real time. It combines computer vision and machine learning to identify individuals using a connected camera module. The system captures video frames, detects faces, and matches them against a stored dataset.

## Key Features
- Uses OpenCV for image processing and face detection  
- Trains and recognises faces using pre-stored images  
- Runs in real time on a Raspberry Pi with minimal delay  
- Can be extended for access control or attendance systems  

## Requirements
- Raspberry Pi (Model 3 or later recommended)  
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module or USB webcam  
- Python 3  
- OpenCV and face recognition libraries  

## How It Works
1. Capture and label face images to build a dataset.  
2. Train the recognition model using the dataset.  
3. Run the detection script to recognise faces live through the camera feed.  

## Use Cases
- Home or lab access control  
- Student or employee attendance tracking  
- Interactive installations or research projects  

You can adapt or expand this project by adding features such as user registration, cloud data storage, or hardware integration (e.g. door lock control).
